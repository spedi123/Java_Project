	<h2>Instructions for Ludo or Sorry!</h2>
	
	<p>First Chose Color:</p>
	<p> Each new user gets to chose a player color or player theme. There are four color options. </p>
	<p>Every player has four horses. And every Ludo game can have between 2 to 4 players. </p>	
	
	<p>How to Start:</p>
	<p>To start the game, one of the players need to roll a 6 to get their horse/piece out on the Ludo track.</p>
	<p>Then the player's horse/piece is ready to move only in forward direction.</p>
	
	<p> Movements of horses/pieces: </p>
	<p>A piece cannot move forward if it will step on itself. </p>
	<p>A piece can destroy the opponent's piece if it steps on it. Then the opponent's piece will be sent back to its home base. Thats why its called Sorry!</p>
	
	<p>How to win: </p>
	<p> The player who can get all of their four horses/pieces to finish line first will win.</p>
